# Tetris!

This is a Tetris clone built using JavaFX libraries for the 2019 Cupertino High
School AP Computer Science A Spring final.

## Gamemodes

### Regular
This is normal, classic Tetris. Play it as you wish.

### Multiplayer
1v1 Tetris. Each time a player clears a row, they are given a point that can
then be used to either drop the opponent's current falling block or start a
five-second *frenzy* mode where all blocks fall three times as fast.

### Blitz
This is normal, classic Tetris, except the blocks fall twice as fast and speed
up twice as fast. The object is to score as many points as possible in two
minutes.
